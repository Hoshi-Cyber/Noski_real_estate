A well‑written listing can make the difference between a quick sale and a stale property. Learn how to describe your home effectively and optimise your listing for search engines.

### Focus on Benefits

Beyond listing the number of bedrooms and baths, highlight what makes your property special. Is there a spectacular view, a recently renovated kitchen or proximity to a popular school? Buyers respond to lifestyle benefits.

### Use High‑Quality Photos

Invest in professional photography or stage your space before taking pictures. Bright, clean and well‑composed images help buyers visualise themselves in the property.

### Optimise for Keywords

Use natural language but include keywords such as the neighbourhood name, property type and unique features. This improves search engine visibility for potential buyers searching online.
