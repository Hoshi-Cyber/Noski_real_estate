Relocating doesn’t have to be chaotic. A well‑planned moving checklist will help you keep track of every detail. Begin six to eight weeks before moving day by decluttering. Sell, donate or recycle items you no longer need. This reduces moving costs and makes your new home easier to organize. Start collecting packing supplies like boxes, bubble wrap and tape.

One month out, notify your landlord or prepare your home for sale handover. Transfer or cancel utilities, change your address with banks and mobile providers, and arrange new services at your future address. Book a reliable moving company early and confirm the date and time with them a week before the move.

On moving day, keep important documents, jewellery and valuables with you rather than in the moving truck. Label all boxes clearly by room and contents, and take photos of assembled electronics to make re‑wiring easier. After arriving, do a walk‑through to check that nothing was left behind and that utilities are working. With a solid plan, your transition will be smoother and less stressful.
