If your property isn’t selling, there’s usually a reason. One frequent mistake is poor presentation. Buyers form impressions quickly, so cluttered rooms, unmade beds and personal belongings can turn them off. Take the time to declutter, clean thoroughly and make small repairs before listing.

Another issue is inflexible viewing schedules. Restricting showings to a few hours a week or demanding 24 hours’ notice limits opportunities. Make your property as accessible as possible to accommodate busy buyers. Similarly, failing to respond promptly to inquiries can suggest disinterest and drive prospects elsewhere.

Finally, ignoring market feedback can be costly. If viewers consistently mention price, layout issues or neighbourhood concerns, address them if possible or adjust your expectations. An experienced agent will relay feedback and recommend strategies to overcome obstacles, ensuring your property doesn’t languish on the market indefinitely.
