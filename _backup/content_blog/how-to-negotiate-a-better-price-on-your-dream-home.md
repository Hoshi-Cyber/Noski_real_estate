Negotiation is an art, but a few practical tactics can save you hundreds of thousands of shillings. Start by arming yourself with data. Research recent sale prices for similar homes in the area and note how long the property has been on the market. If it’s been listed for a while or needs repairs, you may have more leverage.

When you make an offer, be respectful but firm. Consider offering slightly below your maximum budget to give yourself room to manoeuvre. Demonstrate your seriousness by having a mortgage pre‑approval letter and deposit ready; sellers prefer buyers who can move quickly. If the seller counters, respond promptly and stay within your budget.

Don’t get hung up on price alone. Sometimes you can negotiate other terms such as who pays closing costs, what appliances are included, or the completion date. A good agent will help you craft a compelling offer and avoid emotional impulses. Remember that a successful negotiation is about creating a win‑win outcome for both parties.
