Buying your first home is both exciting and daunting. In Kenya’s competitive market it pays to go in prepared. Start by setting a realistic budget that takes into account your savings, expected mortgage rates and additional costs like stamp duty and legal fees. Getting pre‑approval from a lender before you start viewing properties will make you a more credible buyer when it’s time to negotiate.

Once your finances are in order, identify the neighbourhoods that match your lifestyle and long‑term goals. Do you want to be close to work, schools or public transport? Consider future infrastructure projects that could affect value and accessibility. Visiting open houses with a trusted agent will give you a feel for what is available within your price range.

Due diligence is critical. Engage a lawyer experienced in conveyancing to verify title deeds, search for any encumbrances and prepare the Sale Agreement. A qualified valuer will help you avoid overpaying. Finally, negotiate terms that work for you — from the deposit schedule to the closing date — and be ready to walk away if a deal doesn’t align with your goals.
