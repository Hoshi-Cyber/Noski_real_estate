The pandemic accelerated a global shift towards remote work, giving rise to a community of digital nomads who work from anywhere with a reliable internet connection. Kenya, with its pleasant climate, vibrant culture and improving connectivity, has become an attractive base for these mobile professionals. This trend presents opportunities for property owners willing to adapt their rentals.

Digital nomads prioritize fast Wi‑Fi, comfortable workspaces and locations near cafes, coworking hubs and recreational activities. Rentals that cater to this lifestyle — think ergonomic chairs, large desks and plenty of natural light — command higher nightly rates and longer stays. Flexible leases that blend elements of short‑ and medium‑term rental models are also popular.

Property owners should be aware of the needs of this segment and market accordingly. Offer optional services like airport transfers, SIM cards and local orientation. Collaborate with coworking spaces or cafes to provide discounts. As the digital nomad movement grows, catering to these travellers can diversify your income and reduce vacancy.
