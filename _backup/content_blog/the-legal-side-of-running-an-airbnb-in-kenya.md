Operating an Airbnb or other short‑stay rental in Kenya isn’t just about hospitality; it also requires legal compliance. First, confirm that your property’s zoning permits short‑term use. Some homeowners’ associations or apartment blocks restrict rentals to protect security and privacy. Obtain written permission from the management company if necessary.

Secondly, register your business. Hosts must have a Single Business Permit and may need to collect and remit income tax and value‑added tax (VAT) depending on revenue. Keep accurate records of earnings and expenses, and consult a tax professional to understand your obligations. Short‑stay rentals are also subject to tourism levy charges collected by the Tourism Fund.

Finally, ensure you have adequate insurance that covers guest injuries or property damage. Draft clear house rules and a rental agreement to protect yourself in case of disputes. By operating within the law, you can build a reputable business and avoid costly penalties.
