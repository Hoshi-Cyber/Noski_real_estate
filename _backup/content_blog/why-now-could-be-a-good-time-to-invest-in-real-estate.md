Timing the market perfectly is impossible, but certain conditions make property investment more attractive. Interest rates in Kenya have stabilized after recent fluctuations, and lenders are competing for borrowers with innovative mortgage products. Meanwhile, inflation remains within target, preserving the real value of your investment and rental income.

Population growth and rapid urbanization continue to support housing demand. The government’s Big Four agenda on affordable housing is driving infrastructure upgrades and opening up new investment corridors. With the Nairobi Expressway complete and projects like the Konza Technopolis underway, formerly remote areas are becoming attractive to both home buyers and businesses.

Of course, you should still conduct thorough due diligence and invest in quality locations. But if you have the financial means and a medium‑ to long‑term horizon, 2025 may offer a window of opportunity before prices climb in response to economic recovery and infrastructure enhancements.
