Guests judge a property within seconds of walking through the door, so furnishing plays a big role in your success. Start with a neutral colour palette to appeal to a broad audience. Add pops of colour through cushions, rugs and art for warmth and personality. Invest in durable furniture that can withstand frequent use; solid wood beds and easy‑to‑clean sofas are a wise choice.

Next, think about functionality. Provide plenty of storage for clothes and luggage. Equip the kitchen with quality utensils, cookware and small appliances so guests can prepare meals comfortably. Don’t forget essentials like high‑speed Wi‑Fi, a smart TV and universal power outlets. Little touches like fresh flowers or local artwork create a memorable stay.

Finally, prioritize comfort and cleanliness. Use hotel‑grade linens, hypoallergenic pillows and blackout curtains for a restful sleep. Opt for hard‑wearing, washable fabrics. Regularly inspect and replace items that show wear and tear. Well‑thought‑out furnishings enhance your reviews and justify higher rates.
