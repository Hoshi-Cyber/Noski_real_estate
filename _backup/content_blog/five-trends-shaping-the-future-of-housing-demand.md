As society evolves, so do our housing preferences. Five key trends are set to shape demand over the next decade. First, remote work is here to stay. More Kenyans are seeking larger homes with dedicated office space, sometimes in satellite towns where land is cheaper. Second, multi‑generational living is on the rise, prompting a need for flexible layouts that accommodate extended families under one roof.

Third, sustainability has moved from buzzword to necessity. Buyers are increasingly demanding energy‑efficient features like solar panels, rainwater harvesting and natural ventilation. Developers who integrate green technologies will be better positioned in the market. Fourth, lifestyle amenities — gyms, co‑working lounges, children’s play areas — are becoming standard in new developments as residents prioritise convenience and community.

Finally, technology is reshaping the search and purchase process. Virtual tours, digital mortgages and blockchain‑based title transfers will make transactions faster and more transparent. Investors and developers who understand these trends can better anticipate future demand and design projects that stand the test of time.
