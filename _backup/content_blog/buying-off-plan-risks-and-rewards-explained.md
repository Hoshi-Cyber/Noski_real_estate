Off‑plan purchases — buying a property before construction is complete — can offer attractive discounts and flexible payment plans. Developers often require a small deposit followed by staggered instalments, making it easier to get a foot on the property ladder. Early buyers may also have a say in finishes and layout, allowing them to customize their future home.

However, buying off‑plan comes with risks. Project delays, poor workmanship or changes in market conditions could leave you with a property that is worth less than you paid. In extreme cases, unscrupulous developers might disappear with your money or fail to deliver altogether. Mitigate these risks by researching the developer’s track record, checking approvals from authorities and using an escrow account for payments.

Consider your timeline and risk tolerance before proceeding. Off‑plan investments are ideal for those who can wait a few years and are comfortable with some uncertainty. With the right precautions, buying off‑plan can be a smart way to secure a home or investment at a lower entry cost.
