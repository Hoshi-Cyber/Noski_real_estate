Deciding between short‑term and long‑term rentals depends on factors such as location, cash‑flow needs and risk tolerance. Short‑stay rentals can generate higher gross income on a per‑night basis and offer flexibility; you can use the property yourself when it’s vacant and adjust rates for peak seasons. However, they require more management — frequent cleaning, guest communication and dynamic pricing — and may be subject to stricter regulations.

Long‑term rentals provide steady, predictable income with less hands‑on involvement. Tenants sign leases for six months or a year, and you don’t have to worry about vacancy every few days. On the downside, your rates are locked in for the lease term, and problem tenants can be difficult to remove. Maintenance requests and repairs also fall on you.

Hybrid approaches are possible too. Some hosts rent long‑term during low seasons and switch to short‑term when demand rises. Analyse your goals, location and capacity to manage the property before deciding which model suits you best. A professional management company can help you implement either strategy effectively.
