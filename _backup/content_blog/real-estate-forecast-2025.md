The Kenyan property market has experienced steady growth over the past decade, but what lies ahead? In this forecast we examine economic indicators, infrastructure projects and demographic shifts that are likely to affect house prices in 2025.

### Economic Outlook

Kenya’s GDP growth is projected to remain robust, supported by increased foreign investment and a burgeoning tech sector. Moderate inflation and favourable lending rates could keep mortgages accessible to buyers.

### Infrastructure Development

New road networks such as the Nairobi Expressway and improved commuter rail lines are opening up previously overlooked neighbourhoods. Improved transport links reduce commuting time and make outlying suburbs more attractive.

### Demand & Supply

Urbanisation continues to drive demand for housing. However, developers must balance new construction with sustainability and affordability. Expect moderate price appreciation in prime areas and faster growth in emerging suburbs.
