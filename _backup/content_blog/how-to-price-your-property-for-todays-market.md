Pricing a property correctly is both art and science. Start by analysing recent sales of comparable homes in your neighbourhood — known as ‘comps.’ Look at size, condition, amenities and location. Avoid assuming that unique upgrades automatically translate to higher value; buyers may not place the same premium on imported tiles or designer fixtures.

Consider market momentum. In a seller’s market with limited inventory, you can price slightly above recent sales. In a buyer’s market, price competitively to attract interest quickly. Factor in carrying costs such as mortgage payments and utilities if the property sits unsold; sometimes pricing lower for a faster sale yields a better net return.

Finally, leave room for negotiation but don’t overinflate your asking price. An experienced agent will help you balance these factors and monitor feedback from viewings. Adjusting your price early if you’re not getting traction can prevent your listing from becoming stale.
