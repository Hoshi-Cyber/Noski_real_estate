The Kenyan property market continues to evolve, influenced by demographic shifts, infrastructure development and macroeconomic factors. Nairobi remains the most active region, with demand driven by a growing middle class and significant investment in roads, rail and energy projects. At the same time, secondary cities such as Kisumu and Nakuru are experiencing increased activity as investors look beyond the capital for better yields.

Experts predict that residential prices will remain stable in established suburbs but may soften in areas with oversupply. Commercial properties are seeing renewed interest from international firms returning to Kenya after the pandemic, boosting demand for grade A office space. The affordable housing segment, supported by government incentives, is expected to expand further in 2025.

As always, location remains key. Properties near the Nairobi Expressway, the Lamu Port–South Sudan–Ethiopia Transport Corridor and upcoming special economic zones are likely to see above‑average appreciation. Investors should keep an eye on policy changes and infrastructure announcements, as these can create opportunities or risks in different segments of the market.
