Property prices don’t rise or fall in isolation. Understanding the underlying drivers will help you make better investment decisions. Location is the most obvious factor: proximity to schools, shopping centres, transport and employment hubs increases desirability and therefore price. Neighbourhood safety, infrastructure and future development plans also play a role.

Economic indicators are equally important. GDP growth, inflation and interest rates impact borrowing costs and household disposable income. When the economy is strong and employment is high, more people can afford to buy, pushing prices up. Conversely, high interest rates can dampen demand. Government policy — such as tax incentives or housing programmes — can stimulate or slow the market.

Lastly, supply and demand dynamics vary across property types. A glut of luxury apartments may depress prices in that segment even if overall demand is healthy. Keeping track of building approvals and planned developments will give you an idea of future supply. Informed investors analyse these factors collectively rather than relying on headlines alone.
