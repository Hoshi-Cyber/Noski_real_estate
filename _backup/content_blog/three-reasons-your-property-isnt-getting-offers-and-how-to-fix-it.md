If your property has been on the market for months with little interest, it’s time to diagnose the problem. The first culprit is often price. Overpricing based on emotional attachment or unrealistic expectations will deter serious buyers. Work with a valuer or agent to set a price that reflects current market conditions and the unique features of your home.

Secondly, presentation matters. Cluttered rooms, peeling paint and unkempt gardens can make even a spacious property feel unattractive. Invest in minor repairs, a fresh coat of paint and basic landscaping before listing. Professional staging can help buyers visualize how they will use the space.

Lastly, accessibility could be an issue. Limited viewing hours or requiring too much notice may cause buyers to move on. Make your property easy to view and respond promptly to inquiries. If you address pricing, presentation and accessibility, offers are more likely to follow.
