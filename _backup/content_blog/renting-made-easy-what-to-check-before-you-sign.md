Signing a lease can feel rushed when demand for good rentals is high, but it’s worth slowing down to protect yourself. Before you sign on the dotted line, inspect the property thoroughly. Look for damp patches, faulty plumbing, broken fixtures and signs of pest infestations. Test light switches and water pressure, and confirm that all promised appliances are present and working.

Next, review the tenancy agreement carefully. Make sure it spells out the rent, deposit amount, payment schedule, and notice period. Check for clauses about maintenance responsibilities, sub‑letting and penalties for late payment. If anything is unclear, ask the landlord to clarify or amend the contract in writing. In Kenya you are entitled to a lease written in a language you understand.

Finally, verify that the landlord or agent has the legal authority to rent out the property. Request to see a copy of the title or a letter of authorization. Taking these steps up front will help you avoid disputes later and ensure you have a comfortable home throughout your lease.
