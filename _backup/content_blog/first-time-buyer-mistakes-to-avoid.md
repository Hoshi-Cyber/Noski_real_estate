The journey to home ownership is full of lessons, and many first‑time buyers make similar missteps. One of the biggest mistakes is failing to factor in all the costs. Beyond the purchase price there are legal fees, valuation fees, stamp duty, moving expenses and ongoing maintenance. Failing to budget for these can leave you cash‑strapped when it matters most.

Another common error is letting emotion dictate your choices. Falling in love with a property can cloud your judgement, leading you to overlook defects or pay more than it’s worth. Work with a trusted agent and valuer to assess a home objectively. Don’t be rushed by sellers or fear of missing out; the right property will come along.

Lastly, buyers sometimes ignore their future needs. Your lifestyle may change due to marriage, children or job relocation. Consider resale value, neighbourhood development plans and whether the home can adapt to your evolving life. By avoiding these mistakes you’ll make a more informed purchase that serves you well for years to come.
