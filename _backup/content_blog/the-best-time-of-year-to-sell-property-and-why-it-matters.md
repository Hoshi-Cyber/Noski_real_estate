While properties sell all year round, timing your sale can influence both the speed and price of your transaction. In Kenya, the peak season for buyers typically runs from late January through May when the weather is pleasant and families plan moves before the school year begins. Listing your property during this window increases visibility and generates competition among buyers.

The rainy season (usually April to June) can be challenging for viewings, as poor weather discourages travel and makes properties less appealing. However, serious buyers may still be active, and you could benefit from less competition. December and early January tend to be quieter because many people travel or focus on holiday spending.

Ultimately, the right timing depends on your personal circumstances and market dynamics in your area. Working with a knowledgeable agent who understands seasonal patterns will help you choose the optimum moment to list and secure the best possible outcome.
