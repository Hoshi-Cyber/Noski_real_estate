Purchasing property in Nairobi can be a rewarding investment, but it requires careful planning and due diligence. This guide walks you through the essential steps to take before, during and after your purchase.

### Determine Your Budget

Start by assessing your financial situation and obtaining a mortgage pre‑approval. Speak with multiple lenders to compare interest rates and loan terms.

### Identify Your Preferred Location

Consider factors such as proximity to work, schools, transport and amenities. Popular neighbourhoods like Kilimani, Lavington and Karen each offer different lifestyles and price points.

### Engage a Reputable Agent

Work with a licensed real estate agent who understands the local market. They will guide you through property viewings, negotiations and the legal process.

### Conduct Due Diligence

Always verify the property’s title, ensure there are no outstanding rates or encumbrances, and engage a qualified valuer for an independent appraisal. A lawyer specialising in conveyancing will protect your interests during the transaction.
