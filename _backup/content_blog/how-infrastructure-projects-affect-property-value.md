It’s no secret that infrastructure projects have a profound impact on real estate values. New highways reduce commute times and open up previously inaccessible areas for development. A rail link can transform a sleepy town into a thriving commuter hub. In Nairobi, the Standard Gauge Railway and the Nairobi Expressway have already reshaped demand patterns and price levels in adjacent neighbourhoods.

Investors who anticipate these projects stand to benefit. Buying land near the proposed Greater Eastern Bypass or LAPSSET corridor before construction starts could yield substantial capital gains. However, speculative buying carries risks if projects are delayed or cancelled. Always verify that the project is funded and approved, and look at the track record of the implementing agencies.

Infrastructure isn’t limited to transport; utilities like electricity, water and broadband also influence desirability. High‑speed internet and reliable power are increasingly important for home offices and businesses. When evaluating a property, research upcoming public and private investments that could enhance or detract from its value over time.
