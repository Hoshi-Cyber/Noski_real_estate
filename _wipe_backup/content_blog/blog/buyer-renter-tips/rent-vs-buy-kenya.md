### The decision framework
“Rent or buy?” has no one-size answer. Look at **time horizon**, **monthly cash-flow**, **price growth**, **interest rates**, **maintenance**, **service charge**, **mobility needs**, and your **risk tolerance**.

### The break-even formula

Define:

- `R` = current monthly **rent**
- `P` = **purchase price**
- `D` = **down payment** (e.g., 10%)
- `i` = **mortgage interest rate** (annual)
- `t` = **holding period** (years)
- `S` = **stamp duty** + **legal & fees** (buy side)
- `M` = **maintenance** + **service charge** (annual % of P; use 1.5%–2.5% for apartments)
- `g` = **home price growth** (annual)
- `r` = expected **rent inflation** (annual)

> **Break-even** occurs when **total owning cost (net of equity gain)** equals **total rent paid** over `t`.

A quick approximation (works for first pass):

TotalRent(t) ≈ R * 12 * Σ(1+r)^k for k=0→t-1
OwningCost(t) ≈ S + interest_paid(t) + MPt – equity_gain(t)

Where `equity_gain(t)` includes **principal repaid** + **price appreciation** `P*((1+g)^t - 1)`.

### Example A: Nairobi apartment

- Rent `R` = **KES 90,000**/mo (2-bed, Kilimani/Westlands tier)
- Price `P` = **KES 16,500,000**
- Down `D` = **10%**
- Mortgage `i` = **14%** (illustrative)
- Fees & duty `S` ≈ **KES 1.2M**  
- Maintenance & service `M` = **2%** of P (~330k/yr)
- Growth `g` = **4%**; Rent inflation `r` = **5%**
- Horizon `t` = **7 years**

**Result** (simplified finance schedule): Under these inputs, **owning overtakes renting around year 6–7**—mainly because maintenance + interest are heavy in early years. If interest rates fell to **12%** or if you negotiated **P = 15.5M**, break-even would move to **year 5**.

### Example B: Nakuru maisonette

- R = **KES 55,000**
- P = **KES 9,800,000**
- D = **10%**, i = **13.5%**
- S ≈ **KES 700k**, M = **1.5%**
- g = **5%**, r = **4%**
- t = **6 years**

**Result**: **Buying beats renting by year ~4–5**, thanks to lower service charge and slightly stronger expected growth.

### When renting still wins

- You’ll likely **move within 3 years** (job rotation, study, migration).
- Lifestyle is changing (new family, school zone uncertainty).
- You can invest your down payment into **higher-yield, liquid assets** for now.

### When buying is smarter

- You’ll stay **5+ years**, value **stability**, and want **inflation protection**.
- You’ve found a **well-priced unit** in a **strong rental area** (safety net).
- Your **P&I payment** ≈ rent and you can manage **maintenance**.
