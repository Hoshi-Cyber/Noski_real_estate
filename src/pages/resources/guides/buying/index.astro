      <p>Lock financing early. Aim for a fully underwritten pre-approval, not a quick pre-qualification. This strengthens your offer and surfaces issues before you shop.</p>
      <h4>Budget & readiness</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Target <strong>DTI ≤ 36%</strong> (up to 43% with strong compensating factors). Keep <strong>credit utilization &lt; 30%</strong>.</li>
        <li>Plan total cash: <strong>down payment</strong> + <strong>closing costs 2–5%</strong> + <strong>reserves 3–6 months</strong>.</li>
        <li>Decide loan type: Conventional, FHA/insured, VA, or specialized programs. Compare fixed vs. ARM by likely holding period.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Shop lenders like a pro</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Request a <em>written</em> Loan Estimate for a constant scenario. Compare <strong>APR</strong>, discount points, lender fees, and rate-lock terms.</li>
        <li>Ask about float-down options, rate-cap on ARMs, prepayment penalties (avoid), and turn times to clear conditions.</li>
        <li>Get a <strong>fully underwritten pre-approval letter</strong> valid 60–90 days. Update proof of funds for earnest money.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Documents to prepare</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Past 2 years W-2s or tax returns, 30–60 days of pay stubs, 2–3 months of bank statements, ID, and source of large deposits.</li>
        <li>If self-employed: YTD P&amp;L, business returns, and balance sheet. If using gifts: completed gift letter and transfer proof.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm"><strong>Security:</strong> confirm wiring instructions by phone with the settlement office; never rely on email alone to prevent wire fraud.</p>

    bodyHtml: `
      <p>Translate goals into hard criteria and a short list of target neighborhoods. Use data and on-site checks to de-risk decisions.</p>
      <h4>Define the brief</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Must-haves vs. trade-offs: beds/baths, layout, parking, outdoor space, accessibility, pets, and renovation tolerance.</li>
        <li>Location filters: commute time thresholds, school preferences, noise and flood exposure, walkability, future development plans.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Due diligence while touring</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Check age and condition of <strong>roof, HVAC, plumbing, electrical</strong>. Scan for moisture, foundation cracks, and pest activity.</li>
        <li>Ask for <strong>seller disclosures</strong>, recent permits, HOA/strata bylaws and fees, special assessments, rental policies.</li>
        <li>Review micro-market comps: list-to-sale ratios, days on market, price per ft², and seasonal patterns.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Offer timing</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>In hot segments, preview quickly and be offer-ready. In slow segments, monitor price reductions and stale listings for leverage.</li>
      </ul>

    bodyHtml: `
      <p>Submit a clean, credible offer that aligns with your risk tolerance and market reality. Use terms to create value beyond price.</p>
      <h4>Structure</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Price strategy:</strong> base on recent <em>sold</em> comps adjusted for condition and concessions, not asking prices.</li>
        <li><strong>Earnest money:</strong> 1–3% typical. Decide hard/non-refundable timing only after key contingencies are satisfied.</li>
        <li><strong>Contingencies:</strong> inspection, financing, appraisal, and title. Use <em>right-to-request repairs</em> or credits rather than waive blindly.</li>
        <li><strong>Timelines:</strong> inspection in 5–7 days, appraisal order on acceptance, close in 25–45 days depending on loan.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Negotiation tactics</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Pair a solid offer with a short response window. Keep communications professional and fact-based.</li>
        <li>Trade on terms: rent-back, personal property, flexible close, or repair credits. Avoid emotional concessions.</li>
        <li>Multiple offers: consider an <strong>escalation clause</strong> with a defined cap and proof requirement for the next-best offer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm"><strong>Appraisal gaps:</strong> if values are rising, discuss gap coverage limits or re-pricing triggers to protect downside.</p>

      <p>Move from contract to keys with tight task control and clear verifications.</p>
      <h4>Contract-to-close checklist</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Open escrow, deposit earnest money, and calendar all deadlines. Order title search, survey, and payoff statements as needed.</li>
        <li>Schedule inspections (general + specialists if flagged). Negotiate repairs or seller credits via documented addenda.</li>
        <li>Lender underwrites file; provide any conditions quickly. Lock interest rate and confirm homeowners/strata insurance binders.</li>
        <li>Confirm <strong>Closing Disclosure</strong> at least 3 business days before signing. Verify names, figures, and prorations.</li>
        <li>Conduct <strong>final walkthrough</strong> 24–48 hours before closing: repairs complete, utilities on, no new damage, agreed inclusions present.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Funding & keys</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Wire final funds using verified instructions only. Bring ID for signing. After recording, collect keys, remotes, codes, and parking permits.</li>
        <li>Post-close: change locks, set up utilities, file homestead/tax forms if applicable, and store all documents securely.</li>
