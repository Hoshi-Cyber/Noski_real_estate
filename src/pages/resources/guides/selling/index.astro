      <p>Price to maximize <em>net</em>, not just list-to-contract speed. Use verified comps and condition-adjusted deltas, then publish a target band with go/no-go rules.</p>
      <h4>Market intelligence</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Pull sold comps within 0.5–1.0 mi (or similar asset band), ≤180 days, adjusting for bed/bath, GLA, lot, year built, garage, view, and condition.</li>
        <li>Overlay active and pending competition. Track days on market, list-to-sold ratio, price per ft², absorption, and seasonality.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Condition & disclosures</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Walk the home with a repair/staging specialist. Prioritize health/safety, water intrusion, major systems, and high-ROI cosmetics.</li>
        <li>Prep seller disclosures early (known defects, permits, insurance claims). Consider pre-listing inspection where norms support it.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Pricing framework</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>List-to-attract:</strong> list near the lower bound of fair value to widen the buyer pool and drive competition.</li>
        <li><strong>List-to-negotiate:</strong> list mid-range when uniqueness or low supply favors longer exposure.</li>
        <li>Publish a <strong>net sheet</strong> with broker fee, concessions, taxes, transfer/HOA fees, and payoff. Define reduction cadence if no acceptable traffic by day 10–14.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Buyers judge on first glance. Execute a tight punch list that photographs well and survives inspection.</p>
      <h4>High-ROI fixes</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Exterior: landscaping refresh, pressure wash, paint front door, modern house numbers/lighting, repair rails and cracked paths.</li>
        <li>Interior: neutral paint, lighting upgrades to 3000–3500K, hardware swaps (knobs, faucets), deep clean, re-caulk/touch-up trim.</li>
        <li>Systems: service HVAC, test GFCIs/smoke alarms, correct basic plumbing/electrical defects, replace tired carpets or refinish floors as needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Staging & presentation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Declutter by ~50%, remove personal photos, optimize traffic flow, and scale furniture to rooms.</li>
        <li>Prioritize hero shots: kitchen, primary suite, living/great room, outdoor area. Add plants/linens for warmth. No heavy scents.</li>
        <li>Pet/air quality plan: HEPA filters, litter control, yard cleanup; schedule showings around pets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm">Safety: secure meds, documents, firearms. Use lockbox and showing logs. Ring/IoT cameras disclosed where required.</p>

      <p>Your media package is the product online. Ship consistent, platform-ready assets and measure funnel health weekly.</p>
      <h4>Media kit</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Pro photography (vertical + horizontal), twilight exteriors, floor plan with measurements, and optional 3D tour/video reel.</li>
        <li>Feature sheet: upgrades list, utility costs, HOA/strata details, neighborhood highlights, walk/commute scores.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Listing accuracy</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>MLS data verified (beds/baths/GLA/lot/legal). Disclose exclusions. Upload disclosures, inspections, permits.</li>
        <li>Remarks structure: hook sentence → three benefit bullets → call-to-action. Avoid fair-housing risk terms.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Distribution & promotion</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>MLS syndication to portals within hours. Agent email launch to buyer agents with matching criteria. Social reel + carousel posts.</li>
        <li>Paid boosts: geo-targeted reach with lead capture landing page. Retarget portal visitors where policy allows.</li>
        <li>Open houses: two opening-weekend events, signage plan, QR code to disclosure packet, registration for follow-up.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Metrics</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Track views, saves, inquiries, showings, feedback, and second-show ratios. If below market baselines by day 7–10, adjust price or presentation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Negotiate to <em>certainty of close</em> and net. Compare terms using a structured matrix and keep communication professional.</p>
      <h4>Verification</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm buyer's <strong>pre-approval</strong> with lender call, proof of funds for down/closing, and source of any gift funds.</li>
        <li>Assess lender type, turn times, and appraisal risk. Prefer local underwriters with proven close rates.</li>

      <h4>Offer matrix</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Columns: price, earnest money, financing type/LTV, appraisal terms, inspection scope, timelines, concessions, rent-back, contingencies, risk flags.</li>
        <li>Multiple offers: use deadlines, clean counter terms, and—where customary—<strong>escalation clause</strong> with cap and proof of competing offer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Repair economics</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Prefer <strong>credits</strong> over repairs to avoid contractor delay; align credit with buyer's scope and lender rules.</li>
        <li>If repairs required, define licensed trades, permits, receipts, and re-inspection rights.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm">Compliance: observe fair-housing and anti-steering rules; document all material communications and counters.</p>

      <p>Keep the file tight from acceptance to recording. Deadlines, documentation, and wire security are non-negotiable.</p>
      <h4>Contract-to-close</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Open escrow, deposit earnest money, calendar all contingency/remedy dates, and circulate executed disclosures.</li>
        <li>Title search and curative actions (liens, judgments, encroachments). Order HOA/condo docs and resale certificates.</li>
        <li>Appraisal scheduled within 48–72 hours. Support with upgrades list and comps packet. Monitor value risk.</li>
        <li>Coordinate inspection access; negotiate repairs/credits via addenda; verify completion and receipts.</li>
        <li>Lender milestones: conditional approval, conditions cleared, <strong>Closing Disclosure</strong> out ≥3 business days pre-signing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Final steps</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Final walkthrough 24–48 hours pre-close. Confirm inclusions, repairs, cleanliness, and utilities on.</li>
        <li>Settlement statement review: prorations, fees, credits. Confirm payoff and release tracking.</li>
        <li>Wire instructions verified by phone with settlement office; no changes via email. Record → keys/possession per contract.</li>
        <li>Post-close: cancel insurance after transfer, forward mail, provide warranties/manuals, deliver 1099-S where applicable.</li>
