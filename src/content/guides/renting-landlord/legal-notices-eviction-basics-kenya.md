## Foundations
- Use lease clauses consistent with statute.
- Document breaches with dates, amounts, and evidence.

## Notice Types
- Non-payment, breach of covenant, and non-renewal notices.
- Service methods: per lease and law. Keep proof of service.

## Timelines
- Observe cure periods precisely. No self-help actions.

## Court Readiness
- Ledger history, notices, photos, correspondence, maintenance logs.
- Engage counsel early for filings and hearings.

## Alternatives
- Payment plans in writing. Cash-for-keys where cost-effective.
