## Core Protocol
- **Verify parties:** confirm seller/agent identity with national ID and selfie match.
- **Confirm ownership:** recent official search from the land registry; match title and parcel.
- **Check encumbrances:** charges, caveats, liens, disputes.
- **Use regulated escrow:** advocate trust or licensed escrow only.
- **Refuse urgency traps:** no rushed deposits or off-platform links.

## Common Scam Patterns
- Title cloning, impersonation, phantom plots, deposit diversion, double sale.

## Verification Steps
1. Engage an advocate and fix channels.
2. KYC pack: IDs, PINs, company docs, selfie verification.
3. Registry search: official search, mutation plans, survey maps, rates/rents.
4. Site check with licensed surveyor; re-peg beacons.
5. Contract controls: trust deposit, completion docs, refund terms.
6. Call-back to verify wiring instructions.

## Red Flags
- Below-market price without cause, refusal to share originals, “reservation” fees outside trust, inconsistent parcel size.
