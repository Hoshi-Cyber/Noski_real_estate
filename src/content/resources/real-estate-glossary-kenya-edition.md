Real estate comes with its own language, and Kenya is no exception. This glossary compiles definitions of the most common terms youâ€™ll encounter when buying, selling or renting property locally. From legal concepts such as caveats, easements and usufruct to financial jargon like LTV (loan-to-value ratio) and amortisation, we break down complicated terminology into plain language.

Keep this resource handy whenever you read contracts, talk to agents or research investment opportunities. Understanding the vocabulary empowers you to ask informed questions and avoid misunderstandings.
