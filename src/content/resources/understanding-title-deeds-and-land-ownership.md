Land ownership in Kenya is documented through title deeds, which prove legal rights to a parcel. This guide explains the different types of titles—freehold and leasehold—and walks you through the process of verifying a deed’s authenticity. We outline how land registries operate, what searches to conduct and how to confirm boundaries on the ground.

You’ll also learn about common encumbrances such as charges, caveats and restrictions, and how they can affect your transaction. Understanding these concepts empowers buyers to make informed decisions and protects sellers from inadvertently transferring problematic land.
