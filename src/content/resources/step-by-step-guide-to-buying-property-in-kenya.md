Buying safely requires a clear process. This guide walks you through budgeting, area and property shortlist, viewings, and offer strategy. We detail essential due diligence (title searches, charges/caveats, survey/boundaries, compliance) before you commit any funds.

Next, follow the conveyancing timeline—sale agreement, deposits and escrows, consents, stamp duty and registration—plus closing day checks. A printable checklist helps you track documents and responsibilities so nothing slips through the cracks.
