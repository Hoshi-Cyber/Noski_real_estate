Choosing the right agent is essential to a successful property transaction. This list highlights questions you should ask prospective agents before signing a representation agreement. Understanding their experience, marketing strategy and communication style helps you determine if they’re the right fit for your needs.

Key topics include how many similar properties they’ve sold or rented recently, their commission structure, how they plan to advertise your property and their availability for viewings. You should also ask for references from past clients and clarify how they handle negotiations and feedback. Taking the time to vet your agent will save you headaches and maximise your returns.
