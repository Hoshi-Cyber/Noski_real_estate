Managing rental property doesn’t have to be overwhelming. This guide explains how Severino Realty’s management services free you from day-to-day hassles while maximising your returns. We unpack our tiered fee structure—10% for marketing and communications, 11.25% for operations light, and 12.5% for full management—and the benefits included at each level.

You’ll learn about our tenant screening process, maintenance coordination, financial reporting and guest communications. The guide also walks you through the onboarding workflow from sign-up to getting your first payout. If you’re ready to hand over the reins, this resource shows you what to expect.
