Short‑stay rentals like Airbnb have grown rapidly, but hosts must comply with local laws. This guide summarises licensing requirements, zoning restrictions and tax obligations for short‑term rentals in Kenya. We discuss when you need a business permit, how to register with county authorities and how to collect and remit taxes such as the hotel levy.

The guide also touches on safety and insurance considerations, emphasising the importance of adequate liability cover and adherence to health and safety standards. By understanding the legal framework, hosts can avoid fines and build sustainable, profitable hospitality businesses.
