Short-term rentals can be profitable—but only when they’re compliant. This guide outlines typical county permits and licensing, tax registration and filing basics, safety/insurance requirements, and the house rules you should formalize before you host.

You’ll also learn how platform policies (e.g., identity checks, guest verification, cancellations) interact with Kenyan tenancy and consumer laws, plus a pre-listing checklist to reduce disputes and protect your property. Use the included templates to standardize cleaning, check-in/out, and incident reporting.
