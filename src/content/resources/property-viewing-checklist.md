When you schedule a property viewing, it helps to have a plan. Our viewing checklist guides you through the key elements to inspect so you can make an informed decision. From structural issues to neighbourhood considerations, it prompts you to look beyond surface finishes and ask the right questions.

Start with the exterior: check the roof, walls, windows and drainage to spot any obvious repairs. Inside, pay attention to plumbing, electrical fixtures, ventilation and natural light. Test taps, sockets and appliances to ensure everything is functional. Donâ€™t forget to observe noise levels at different times of day and confirm that security measures such as gates and grills are in place. Finally, review amenities and parking arrangements if you are buying or renting in a multi-unit development.
