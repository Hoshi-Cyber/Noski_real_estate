Landlords and property managers require consistent information from every prospective tenant. This template provides a structured form for renters to submit their personal details, employment information, references and consent for background checks. Using a standardised application reduces back-and-forth communication and helps landlords evaluate applicants fairly.

The template covers critical sections such as current and previous residence history, income verification, next of kin and emergency contacts. It also includes a declaration section where the applicant authorises credit and rental history checks. Feel free to customise the form with your branding and any additional clauses required for your specific properties or local regulations.
