When a tenant moves in or out, documenting the propertyâ€™s condition protects both parties. This handover form provides a structured checklist to record the state of fixtures, appliances, walls, flooring and outdoor spaces. A jointly signed form reduces disputes when refunding the deposit and clarifies who is responsible for any damage.

The document is divided by rooms and includes sections for meter readings, key counts and any pre-existing defects. Both landlord and tenant should walk through the property together, note observations and agree on follow-up actions. Retain a copy of the signed form for your records and refer to it when determining deductions from the deposit at the end of the lease.
