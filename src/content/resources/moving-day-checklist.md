Moving into a new home is exciting but stressful. Use this checklist to organise your tasks before, during and after moving day. Weeks ahead, schedule movers or enlist friends, order packing supplies and start decluttering. Label boxes by room so they end up in the right place and note fragile items to avoid breakage.

On the day itself, ensure utilities are connected and confirm access with your landlord or agent. Pack a personal essentials bag containing items like toiletries, chargers and a change of clothes so you don’t have to dig through boxes immediately. After the move, complete a thorough walk‑through, note any damages and update your address with banks, employers and service providers. Staying organised helps you settle in quickly and enjoy your new space.
