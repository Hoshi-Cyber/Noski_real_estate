Selling a property starts long before a buyer walks through the door. Our pre-listing checklist helps you prepare your home so it looks its best and attracts serious offers. Decluttering, deep cleaning and minor repairs can dramatically improve first impressions. Staging your space with neutral decor and natural light allows potential buyers to envision themselves living there.

The checklist also reminds you to gather important documents such as title deeds, utility bills and maintenance records. Arrange for a professional valuation so you can price your property competitively. Finally, schedule a photo shoot with a professional photographer to showcase your home online. Following these steps will set you up for a smoother, more profitable sale.
