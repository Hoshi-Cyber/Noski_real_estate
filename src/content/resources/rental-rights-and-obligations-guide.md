Renting a home is governed by the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act and other regulations. This guide summarises the rights and responsibilities of both landlords and tenants under Kenyan law. It explains notice periods, rent increments, maintenance obligations and dispute resolution mechanisms.

Tenants will learn how to formally lodge complaints against unfair practices and when they can withhold rent. Landlords can familiarise themselves with lawful eviction procedures, security deposit rules and their obligation to provide habitable premises. Understanding the law helps both parties avoid misunderstandings and maintain cordial relationships.
