### 1) Why amenities matter
- Guests filter listings by key amenities.  
- Properties with Wi-Fi and backup power rank higher on portals.  

### 2) Essential amenities
- Reliable Wi-Fi (fiber or 4G backup).  
- Power backup: inverter or generator.  
- Water storage: tank + pump.  
- Comfortable work desk + chair.  

### 3) High-demand extras
- Smart TV with Netflix.  
- Washing machine for longer stays.  
- Secure parking.  
- Air conditioning at the Coast.  

### 4) ROI analysis
- Fiber Wi-Fi (KES 3.5k/month) can increase ADR by 10–15%.  
- Inverter (KES 120k setup) pays back in 12–15 months via higher occupancy.  
- Furnished workspace attracts digital nomads and corporates.  

### 5) Mistakes to avoid
- Advertising amenities you don’t have.  
- Poor quality basics (thin mattresses, broken chairs).  
- Ignoring local demand (e.g., AC in Nairobi is wasted).  

### FAQs
**Q: Should I provide daily housekeeping?**  
A: For premium listings, yes. Budget listings can stick to turnover cleaning.  

**Q: Are swimming pools worth adding?**  
A: Only for coastal or luxury villas. ROI is low for mid-market.
