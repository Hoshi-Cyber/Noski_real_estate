### 1) Why short-stay rentals work
- Nairobi CBD, Kilimani, Westlands: strong demand from corporates and expats.  
- Coastal towns: seasonal peaks in December–March and July–Sept.  
- Higher ADR (Average Daily Rate) than long-term leases, but with variability.

### 2) Setup costs
- Furniture & décor: KES 250k–600k for 1BR–2BR.  
- Appliances: fridge, cooker, washing machine (KES 150k–300k).  
- Smart locks + Wi-Fi setup: KES 30k–80k.  
- Licensing, permits: ~KES 20k.  
- Contingency: 10% buffer.  

### 3) Revenue drivers
- ADR in Nairobi: KES 3,500–7,000/night.  
- Coastal villas: KES 15k–40k/night depending on size.  
- Occupancy rates: 40–70% typical, 80% in peak.  

### 4) Payback timelines
- 1BR in Nairobi: breakeven in 14–18 months if >60% occupancy.  
- Villas at the coast: 24–30 months due to higher setup.  

### 5) Common mistakes
- Underestimating furnishing costs.  
- Ignoring service charge and utilities.  
- Overpricing in low season → low occupancy.
