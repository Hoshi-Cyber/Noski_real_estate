### 1) Why OTA rankings matter
- Higher placement = more impressions and bookings.  
- Guests rarely scroll past page 2 of search results.  
- Algorithms reward responsiveness, accuracy, and competitive pricing.  

### 2) Response time
- Aim to reply within **1 hour** of enquiry.  
- Instant Book boosts ranking significantly.  
- Use automated replies for after-hours messages.  

### 3) Listing content
- Upload 20+ high-quality photos covering all rooms.  
- Detailed, keyword-rich description (neighbourhood, amenities).  
- Keep calendar updated daily—stale calendars drop rank.  

### 4) Pricing health
- Align with market averages for location/season.  
- Avoid constant cancellations—penalised by OTAs.  
- Use Smart Pricing tools to stay competitive.  

### 5) Continuous optimisation
- Track conversion rate (views → bookings).  
- Request guest reviews promptly.  
- Refresh photos and descriptions quarterly.  

### FAQs
**Q: Does Superhost/Preferred Partner status affect ranking?**  
A: Yes. Consistently high ratings and low cancellations increase visibility.  

**Q: Can boosting ads on OTAs improve rank?**  
A: Temporarily, yes. But long-term ranking depends on organic performance.
