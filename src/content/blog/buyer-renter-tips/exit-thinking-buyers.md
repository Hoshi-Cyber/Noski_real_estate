### 1) Why exit planning matters
- Real estate is illiquid; resale horizon 5–10 years.  
- Planning early reduces holding risks.  
- Investors who ignore resale often face liquidity crunches.  

### 2) Resale windows
- Strongest within 5–7 years of completion.  
- Later, supply of newer projects competes down values.  
- Timing tied to demand cycles (e.g., diaspora inflows).  

### 3) Tenant demand
- Areas near universities, CBD offices, industrial parks → higher occupancy.  
- Tenant demand influences both yield and resale price.  
- Example: Juja & Ruiru → student demand; Syokimau → airport staff.  

### 4) Upgrade potential
- Smart upgrades raise resale by 10–20%.  
- Common upgrades: DSQs, solar backup, modern kitchens, parking.  
- Avoid overcapitalization; ROI should be measurable.  

### 5) Buyer checklist
- Liquidity score (ease of selling).  
- Depth of rental market.  
- HOA rules (restricting improvements).  
- Infrastructure pipeline (new roads, bypasses).  
- Plan resale window before buying.
