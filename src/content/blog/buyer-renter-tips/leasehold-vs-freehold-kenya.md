### 1) What leasehold means
- Ownership for a **fixed term (commonly 50–99 years)**.  
- Annual **land rent** payable to government/county.  
- Renewal must be applied for before expiry.

### 2) What freehold means
- Absolute ownership, unlimited in duration.  
- No annual rent, only statutory rates/land taxes.  
- Preferred by many buyers but rarer in urban areas.

### 3) Key verifications for buyers
- **Balance of lease term** — confirm via title and deed plan.  
- **Rent arrears** — unpaid rent becomes buyer’s liability.  
- **User restrictions** — residential, commercial, agricultural.  
- **Renewal status** — if below 25 years, negotiate pricing or require renewal before transfer.

### 4) Impact on resale and lending
- Banks often require **≥35 years remaining** for mortgage.  
- Properties with <25 years left may have depressed resale value.  
- Freehold typically offers better long-term appreciation.

### 5) FAQs
**Q: Can a leasehold be converted to freehold?**  
A: Yes, under certain policies for residential/agricultural land, subject to approvals and fees.

**Q: What happens if lease expires?**  
A: Land reverts to government unless renewed; improvements may be compensated.
