### 1) Why Nanyuki & Naivasha
- Nanyuki: expat hub, tourism gateway, scenic climate.  
- Naivasha: 90 mins from Nairobi, weekend hotspot, lakeside living.  
- Diaspora and NGOs driving villa purchases.  

### 2) Property types
- Nanyuki: villas 20M–45M, cottages 12M–25M.  
- Naivasha: cottages 10M–20M, villas 20M–35M.  
- Both markets tied to Airbnb and corporate lets.  

### 3) Mixed use model
- Owners spend 4–6 weekends annually in property.  
- Rest of year → rented as Airbnb.  
- Corporate lets for NGOs and conferences cover off-season.  

### 4) Rental offset math
- **Nanyuki villa**: 25M; rents 200k/month → 9–10% yield.  
- **Naivasha cottage**: 15M; 15–30k per night; peak season occupancy 60%.  
- **Offset:** typically 40–60% of holding cost covered.  

### 5) Risks
- Seasonality: Naivasha higher weekend demand; Nanyuki more steady with expats.  
- Management: 15–20% cut to local operators.  
- Regulatory uncertainty on short lets.  

### 6) Case examples
- Nairobi buyer offsets 50% mortgage on Naivasha property with Airbnb.  
- Nanyuki home rented to NGO field staff yields consistent 8%.  
- Diaspora investor doubled property value in 5 years.
