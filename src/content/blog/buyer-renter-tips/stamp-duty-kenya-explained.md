### What is stamp duty and who pays?
Stamp duty is a **transfer tax** due on instruments conveying property. In typical private sales, **the buyer pays** duty upon transfer/registration.

### Rates and how they’re assessed
- **Urban property**: **4%**
- **Rural property**: **2%**

Duty is charged on the **higher of**:
1) **Declared purchase price**, or  
2) **Government valuation** (from the Chief Government Valuer / county valuation).

If the valuation is **higher** than your price, you’ll pay **more duty**. Your advocate will advise on appeals where applicable.

### Exemptions and reliefs (illustrative, confirm current law)
- **Transfers between spouses** (e.g., to add a spouse to title) may qualify for relief.
- **Corporate restructurings** that meet conditions.  
- **Low-cost housing initiatives** and specific policy windows sometimes offer **stamp duty rebates/exemptions**—watch Finance Acts and KRA notices.

> **Note**: Policies evolve—confirm eligibility with your advocate before you anchor budgets.

### Budgeting & cash-flow tips
- Duty is **due at completion**, so keep it liquid; don’t tie it up in furniture before registration.
- If you’re **mortgaging**, remember **duty on charge** (~0.1%) and **registration fees**.
- Consider an **escrowed completion** where funds are released post-registration—reduces risk while meeting timelines.

### Process: from assessment to payment
1. **Submit** executed transfer instrument and valuation request.
2. **Valuation** is issued; your advocate reviews.
3. **Assessment** is raised in iTax/ArdhiSasa; you receive **payment slips**.
4. **Pay** duty (and charge duty if mortgaged).
5. **Lodge for registration** with stamped instrument and clearances.
6. **Collect title/lease** once registered; proceed to **possession** as per Sale Agreement.

### FAQs
**Q: Can duty be financed?**  
A: Some lenders allow **duty + fees** to be part of total financing (case-by-case). Otherwise, plan to pay from savings.

**Q: Are first-time buyers exempt?**  
A: There have been **policy discussions** on reliefs for affordable segments; treat any exemption as **policy-dependent** and confirm current position.

**Q: Off-plan purchases?**  
A: Duty is typically paid upon transfer of the **completed unit** (not at reservation). However, review your contract for timing.
