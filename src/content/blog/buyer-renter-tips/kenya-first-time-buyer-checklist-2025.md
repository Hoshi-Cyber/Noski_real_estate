## 1) Budget: true cost of buying

**Purchase price** is only the start. A realistic first-home budget in Kenya usually includes:

- **Stamp duty**: commonly **4% (urban)** or **2% (rural)** of the property value. Always confirm current policy with KRA or your advocate; incentives and exemptions can change.
- **Legal (conveyancing) fees**: tiered scale; plan ~**1%â€“1.5%** of price (plus VAT).
- **Valuation** (for mortgage): lenderâ€™s panel valuerâ€”**KES 15kâ€“60k**+ depending on value/location.
- **Loan/mortgage costs**: application fees (~1%), negotiation fees, credit life insurance, **stamp duty on charge** (~0.1%), and **deed registration**.
- **Agency fee** (usually paid by seller, but confirm).
- **Searches & clearances**: title search (~KES 500â€“1,000), rates/rent clearance, consent to transfer where applicable.
- **Move-in & set-up**: prepaid power tokens, water deposits, internet, curtains, basic repairs (set aside **1%â€“2%**).
- **Service charge & sinking fund** (apartments/estates): pro-rations at completion.

> **Rule of thumb**: Aim for **6%â€“8% on top of price** for cash buys; **8%â€“10%** if mortgaged.

## 2) Documents youâ€™ll need

- **National ID/Passport** and **KRA PIN** (or **Non-Resident PIN** for diaspora).
- **Bank statements / payslips** (3â€“6 months) if financing.
- **Sale Agreement** drafted/approved by your advocate.
- **Offer/acceptance letter** and **receipt** for deposit.
- **Spousal consent** (where applicable).
- **POA** if buying from abroad (notarised & registered).
- **Company docs** (if buying via company): CR12, resolution to purchase.

## 3) Due diligence & searches

Engage a **licensed advocate** early. Typical checks:

1. **Title search** at the registry (or **ArdhiSasa** where digitised) verifying:
   - **Registered owner**, **encumbrances** (charges, cautions, caveats), **size**, **user**, **tenure** (freehold/leasehold), **balance of term** for leasehold.
2. **Rates/Rent clearance** (county/NLC).
3. **Survey/Beacons**: confirm boundaries with a surveyor; match deed plan to ground.
4. **Management & service charge** (sectional properties): bylaws, arrears, pets/parking rules.
5. **Developer due diligence** (if off-plan): previous handovers, escrow arrangements, defects policy, approvals, and NCA/NEMA where applicable.

## 4) The timeline (typical 45â€“90 days)

**Week 0â€“2** â€” Offer & deposit
- Negotiate price/terms, agree on **deposit (10% typical)**, sign intent or offer letter.
- Open purchase file with your advocate.

**Week 2â€“6** â€” Sale Agreement & searches
- Advocate drafts/negotiates the **Sale Agreement** (SA). Ensure:
  - Conditions precedent (e.g., **financing approval window 21â€“30 days**).
  - Clear **completion date** and what constitutes vacant possession.
  - Fixtures/fittings included; penalties for default.
- Conduct searches and obtain consents/clearances.

**Week 6â€“10** â€” Completion & transfer
- Balance paid to vendorâ€™s advocate (often **held in escrow** pending registration).
- Execute transfer; **stamp** and **register**.
- Collect **completion documents** (original title/lease, rates clearance, consents, discharge if any).
- **Handover**: meters, keys, inventories; sign possession letter.

## 5) Mistakes that cost first-time buyers

- **Paying deposit to the seller directly** instead of the **vendorâ€™s advocateâ€™s client account**.
- **Skipping a title search** or buying before confirming **encumbrances**.
- **Ignoring service charge arrears** that later become your problem.
- **Not budgeting** for stamp duty and legal costsâ€”causing delays or default.
- **Over-committing on mortgage** without pre-approval and realistic stress-test.

## 6) Handy downloads & next steps

- **Checklist PDF** (budget + docs) â€” *add link when uploaded to /assets*
