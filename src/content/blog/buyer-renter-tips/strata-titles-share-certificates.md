### 1) What is a strata title?
- Individual ownership title for an apartment or townhouse unit.  
- Governed by the **Sectional Properties Act 2020**.  
- Buyers hold a deed registered at the Lands Registry.  
- Enables resale, inheritance, mortgage financing.  

### 2) What is a share certificate?
- Ownership of shares in a company that holds the mother title.  
- Rights to occupy a unit are granted via shareholder agreement.  
- Popular in Nairobi estates from 1980s–1990s (e.g., Pangani, South B).  
- Legally weaker than strata titles for resale and financing.  

### 3) Legal framework
- Strata titles recognized under the Land Act and Sectional Properties Act.  
- Government actively converting older share-certificate schemes into sectional titles.  
- Buyers should ask if the apartment project has **registration under sectional scheme number**.  

### 4) Key differences
| Aspect         | Strata Title             | Share Certificate             |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Ownership      | Individual deed          | Company shares                |
| Financing      | Accepted by banks         | Rarely financed               |
| Resale         | Simple at Lands Registry | Dependent on company approval |
| HOA control    | By-laws, registered      | Company board                 |

### 5) Financing and resale
- **Banks**: 90% of banks only finance strata title properties.  
- **Resale**: strata units take 2–3 months to transact; share certificate units may take 6–12 months.  

### 6) Risks and protections
- **Share certificate risks**: governance disputes, board approvals, limited collateral use.  
- **Protections**: confirm company returns at Registrar of Companies; seek legal opinion on conversion to strata.  

### 7) Buyer due diligence checklist
- Confirm **title deed copy** and sectional plan.  
- Ask developer for **occupation certificate**.  
- Check mother title status (any caveats, charges).  
- For share certificates, verify company filings and litigation history.
