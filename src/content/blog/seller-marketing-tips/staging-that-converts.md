### 1) Why staging matters
- Staged homes in Kenya sell 30–40% faster.  
- Buyers first encounter listings online—photos make or break enquiries.

- Deep clean: kitchens, bathrooms, windows.  
- Repair: fix small damages before staging.  

### 3) Staging for photography
- Focus on living room, kitchen, master bedroom.  
- Use neutral colour schemes and good lighting.  
- Add props: flowers, rugs, cushions.

- Ensure good airflow; open windows.  
- Light scented candles sparingly.

- ROI often >200k in increased price or reduced DOM.  

### 6) Mistakes to avoid
- Overstaging—home should look lived in, not artificial.  
- Ignoring outdoor areas like balconies and gardens.  
- Using colours too bold for broad appeal.
