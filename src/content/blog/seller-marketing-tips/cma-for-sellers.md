### 1) What is a CMA?
- A Comparable Market Analysis estimates property value based on sold properties.  
- Crucial to price realistically and build seller confidence.  

### 2) How to gather comps
- Use properties sold in past 6 months, ideally 3–6 units.  
- Stay within 1–2 km radius in Nairobi; broader in rural counties.  
- Check county land registry or portal sales records.  

### 3) Adjusting comps for accuracy
- Condition: newly built vs 10-year-old.  
- Lot size: maisonette with 1/8 acre vs townhouse on 1/16.  
- Amenities: borehole, generator, gym.  
- Location: proximity to new bypass can add 10–15%.  

### 4) Price-per-square-metre analysis
- Calculate by dividing price by size.  
- Example: 150 sqm unit at 15M → 100k/sqm.  
- Compare across 5 properties to find range.  

### 5) Expired and withdrawn listings
- Properties that failed to sell are warning signs.  
- Use them to persuade sellers not to overprice.  

### 6) Narrative and presentation
- Use charts and visuals.  
- Show side-by-side comparison with recent sales.  
- Frame property as “best positioned for value and absorption.”  

### 7) Mistakes to avoid
- Relying only on asking prices.  
- Ignoring current absorption and DOM.  
- Failing to adjust comps for differences.  

### FAQs
**Q: How do I handle a seller who insists on higher pricing?**  
A: Present data on DOM and expired listings. Offer pricing bands and show opportunity cost.  

**Q: Can a CMA influence buyer perception?**  
A: Yes, agents can use it as marketing to justify price.
