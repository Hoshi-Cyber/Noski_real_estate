### 1) Why pre-list repairs matter
- First impressions drive offers. Buyers in Kenya judge condition heavily from photos.  
- A KES 50k repair budget can yield a KES 200k+ increase in sale price.  

### 2) Top ROI repairs
- **Neutral paint** (KES 100–150/sqft). Refreshes look, photographs brighter.  
- **Lighting upgrades**: warm LEDs, chandeliers in dining, security lighting outdoors.  
- **Fixtures**: replace leaking taps, squeaky handles, broken switches.  
- **Curb appeal**: repaint gates, trim hedges, fix driveways.  

### 3) Budget-friendly upgrades
- Deep cleaning (KES 5k–15k).  
- Pressure wash walls, tiles, driveways.  
- Replace worn curtains with neutral, modern ones.  

### 4) Repairs to avoid
- Full kitchen or bathroom overhauls. ROI rarely recovered.  
- Swimming pool installations. Maintenance deters most buyers.  
- Imported luxury finishes for mid-market homes.  

### 5) Kenyan case examples
- Westlands apartment: repaint + lighting = sold 25 days faster.  
- Kitengela maisonette: curb repairs raised sale price by 7%.  
- Nyali villa: outdoor repaint led to 12% more buyer enquiries online.  

### 6) Mistakes to avoid
- Over-investing in personal taste upgrades.  
- Ignoring small repairs like cracked tiles—buyers notice.  
- Spending heavily on low-ROI luxury items.  

### FAQs
**Q: Do I need to repaint if walls are in good condition?**  
A: If colours are bold or personalised, yes—neutral tones sell faster.  

**Q: Do small repairs affect valuation?**  
A: Yes, valuers adjust for condition; poor condition can drop price bands.
