### 1) Why price reductions matter
- Prolonged DOM reduces perceived value.  
- Strategic reductions revive attention.

- <10 enquiries in first 2 weeks.  
- View-to-offer ratio <10%.  
- DOM exceeds area median by 30%+.

- Refresh photos and description simultaneously.  
- Announce “new price” prominently online.

- Kilimani apartment dropped 5% = sale in 21 days.  
- Nakuru maisonette: 10% cut led to 3 offers within 10 days.  

### 5) Mistakes to avoid
- Repeated small reductions (signals desperation).  
- Waiting too long (>90 days) to adjust.
