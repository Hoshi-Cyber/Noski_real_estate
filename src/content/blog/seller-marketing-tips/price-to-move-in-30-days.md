### 1) Why speed matters
- Listings lose leverage the longer they sit unsold.  
- Buyers begin to assume hidden flaws when DOM exceeds area average.  
- In Kenya, properties that move in <45 days often achieve 95%–98% of asking.  

### 2) DOM benchmarks in Kenya
- Nairobi apartments: 60–90 days median.  
- Kiambu/Satellite towns: 45–75 days.  
- Mombasa coastal homes: 120+ days common.  
- Tip: Always ask your agent for median DOM for your submarket.  

### 3) Absorption rates explained
- Measures how fast inventory sells.  
- Formula: monthly sales ÷ active listings.  
- Example: Ruaka has 200 active listings, 20 sales per month → 10% absorption → oversupply.  
- A 20%+ absorption rate = strong seller’s market.  

### 4) Banding psychology
- Buyers search by round numbers (KES 10M, 15M).  
- Price just under the cut-off for higher visibility (9.95M instead of 10M).  
- Works especially well on online portals and mortgage affordability filters.  

### 5) Practical pricing steps
- Gather 5–7 recent comps.  
- Adjust for age, finishes, amenities.  
- Place listing slightly below active but unsold properties.  
- Monitor response in first 2 weeks; adjust if traffic is low.  

### 6) Market examples
- Kilimani 3BR: median 15M. Units priced at 15.9M average 120 DOM; those at 14.5M close within 45 days.  
- Nakuru maisonette: average 9.8M. Homes priced 5% below median close 40% faster.  

### 7) Common mistakes to avoid
- Overpricing to “leave room” for negotiation.  
- Ignoring absorption rate trends.  
- Comparing to asking prices instead of sold prices.  

### FAQs
**Q: Should I always underprice?**  
A: No. Underpricing too far can raise suspicion. Aim for 3–5% below market, not 10%+.  

**Q: How soon should I reduce if enquiries are low?**  
A: Within 3 weeks. Delays increase DOM and reduce leverage.
