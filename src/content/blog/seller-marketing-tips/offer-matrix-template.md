### 1) Why use an offer matrix
- Keeps negotiations objective.  
- Compares beyond price: timelines, proof of funds, conditions.  
- Protects fairness and reduces bias.  

### 2) Core fields to include
- Offered price.  
- Deposit size + proof.  
- Financing method (cash, mortgage, SACCO).  
- Completion date.  
- Conditions (repairs, approvals, sale of another property).  

### 3) Weighting factors
- Price: 40%.  
- Financing certainty: 25%.  
- Timeline: 20%.  
- Other conditions: 15%.  

### 4) Example matrix
| Buyer | Price | Deposit | Financing | Completion | Conditions | Score |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------|------------|------------|-------|
| A     | 15M   | 20%     | Cash      | 30 days    | None       | 92    |
| B     | 15.5M | 10%     | Mortgage  | 60 days    | Valuation  | 81    |

### 5) How to present to sellers
- Use weighted scoring to justify recommendation.  
- Keep process transparent.  

### 6) Mistakes to avoid
- Ignoring proof of funds.  
- Overvaluing higher price with weak financing.  

### FAQs
**Q: Can sellers reject highest-scoring offer?**  
A: Yes, but agent must record rationale.  

**Q: Should mortgage pre-approvals be required?**  
A: For serious offers, yes. It reduces fall-through risk.
